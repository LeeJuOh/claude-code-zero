# AGENTS.md

## Repository Overview

Personal marketplace for Claude Code plugins. Plugins are developed under `plugins/` and deployments are managed through `marketplace.json`.

## Directory Structure

```
.claude-plugin/marketplace.json   # Marketplace definition (plugin registry)
plugins/<plugin-name>/            # Plugin source code (git-committed)
references/                       # External reference materials (git-ignored)
```

## Plugin Development

### Plugin Component Structure

Standard plugin layout inside `plugins/<plugin-name>/`:

```
.claude-plugin/plugin.json   # Plugin manifest (no version — version lives in marketplace.json)
commands/                     # Slash commands — legacy; use skills/ for new skills
skills/                       # Skills with SKILL.md
agents/                       # Sub-agents (*.md)
hooks/                        # Hooks (hooks.json + scripts)
.mcp.json                    # MCP server configuration (optional)
```

### Workflow

Applies to all plugin work: creation, modification, improvement, and refactoring.

1. **Analysis** — Understand the goal and read relevant files.
2. **Implementation** — Create or modify files under `plugins/`. Never modify files in `references/`.
3. **Registration** — Add the plugin entry to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (new plugins only).

## references/ Folder

- Git-ignored. External open-source code stored here for local reference only.
- Never explore this folder on your own. Never modify files in it.

## Git Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- **`develop`** — Working branch. All development happens here.
- **`main`** — Release branch. Only updated via merges from `develop`. Never commit directly.

### Commit Rules

- English only, 1-2 concise sentences focusing on the core change.
- Do NOT append `Co-Authored-By` trailers.
- Do NOT auto-push after committing. Only push when the user explicitly requests it.

### Tagging & Versioning

- Tags are created on `main` only. Never tag on `develop`.
- Tag format: `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` (e.g., `v1.5.0`).
- Plugin versions in `marketplace.json` follow Semantic Versioning:
  - **patch** (`x.x.+1`) — Bug fixes, minor text edits, config tweaks.
  - **minor** (`x.+1.0`) — New features, structural changes, plugin renames.
  - **major** (`+1.0.0`) — Breaking changes to the plugin's interface or behavior.
- Repository tag version reflects overall release scope, not individual plugin versions.

### Plugin Rename Handling

When renaming a plugin (e.g., `extension-wiki` → `agent-extension-wiki`):

1. Update the `name` and `source` fields in `marketplace.json`.
2. Bump the version (at least minor) to signal the change.
3. Update the `description` if scope has changed.

### Release Workflow (Tagging on main)

When the user requests a tag on `main`:

1. **Compare branches** — Run `git log main..develop --oneline` and `git diff main..develop --stat` to list all changes.
2. **Ask about marketplace update** — Show each plugin's current version and what changed since `main`. Ask which plugins should have their version bumped and by how much.
3. **Update on develop** — Update `marketplace.json` for selected plugins. Commit (e.g., `release: bump versions for <tag>`).
4. **Merge to main** — Switch to `main` and merge `develop` (no fast-forward: `git merge --no-ff develop`).
5. **Create tag** — Create the annotated tag on `main` (e.g., `git tag -a v1.5.0 -m "v1.5.0"`).
6. **Switch back** — Return to `develop`.
7. **Confirm push** — Ask the user before pushing `main`, `develop`, and the tag to remote.

## Coding Style

- **Language**: All plugin deliverables in English (SKILL.md, agent.md, README.md, comments, descriptions, code).
- **Plugin names**: kebab-case (e.g., `notebook-researcher`, `code-reviewer`)
- **Versioning**: Semantic Versioning (e.g., `1.0.0`). Version is set only in `marketplace.json`, not in individual `plugin.json` files (all plugins use relative-path sources).
- **Descriptions**: Clear and concise
